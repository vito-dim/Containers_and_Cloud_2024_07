    uptime
    
History of executed commands:
    history
    
History of executed commands are also kept in:
    file: .bash_history, located in user's home directory
    for example:
        for root:
            /root/.bash_history
        for admin:
            /home/admin/.bash_history

Note:
    Some commands are not here and there is a perfect explanation for this. 
    The reason is that they are kept in a buffer and are stored on the disk only when certain events occur, like session end.
